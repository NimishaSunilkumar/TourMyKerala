                    <p>Backwater is a part of the river where there is no movement and current. The backwaters are
                        formed by the action of waves
                        and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of rivers flowing down from
                        the Western Ghats range.
                        The geographical condition of Kerala is so tremendous that there are mazelike waterways running
                        almost across the state.
                        The lowest tide of the Arabian Sea, which has a high concentration of salt, enters these
                        waterways and the backwater is
                        formed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The backwaters of Kerala are a network of 1500 km-long canal both man-made and natural, 38
                        silent rivers and 5 big lakes
                        extending from one end of Kerala to the other. The backwaters have a unique ecosystem -
                        freshwater from the rivers meets
                        the seawater from the Arabian Sea. In the middle of the waterways, there are many hidden
                        islands, towns and cities.

                            starts showing its true colors.
                            Located in the Kollam district of Kerala, Ashtamudi Lake is one of the largest freshwater
                            lakes in India. This palm-shaped
                            lake has recently emerged as one of the most visited regions in Kerala. Ashtamudi Lake is
                            the main source of water for many
                            other water bodies in Kerala. Amidst the lake, there are 3 prominent islands namely Munroe
                            Island, Chavara Island and
                            Thekkumbhagom Island.

                            For the tourists who want to catch sight of unique avian animals, then they should go for a

                            the bank of Ashtamudi lake. While passing through the houseboats, one can see many varieties
                            of birds and herbal trees
                            stationed on the multiple islands within the backwaters. On the bank of Ashtamudi lake, the

                            One can see a million of lilies and lotuses sprouting on this stretch which simply looks
                            like a queen's pearl necklace.
                            The famous snake boat competition is organized here during Onam. It is indeed amazing to
                            watch oarsmen, at least a hundred
                            of them in one boat, slice their way through the waters to the fast rhythm of their own full
                            throated singing. On the
                            boulevard of this stretch, tourists can spot some magnificent birds at the Kumarakom bird
                            sanctuary. The bird sanctuary
                            is an ornithologist's fantasy, with a significant number of rare breeds gathered in one
                            small area. Within the backwaters,
                            there are many islands. Among the islands, Wellingdon Island deserves special mention as it
                            houses the Port of Cochin and the largest naval presence in India: the Southern Naval
                            Command.
