                    <p>Kerala is the most picturesque of Indian states, one that holds the pristine blue water, white
                        sand, vibrant coral reefs, a calmness that fills in the air and temples speaking volume of a
                        bygone era. This tiny state is sandwiched between the marvellous Arabian Sea and lush green
                        Western Ghats. Emerald and sapphire are the two prominent colour of Kerala. One is the colour of
                        swaying palm grooves and other is of beaches that dot the landscapes. One is the colour of its
                        swaying palm groves and the other is of the many lakes, rivers and water bodies that dot its
                        landscape.
                        Located on the southern tip of India, Kerala is one of those isolated and dreamy locations which
                        one often sees in movies. The white sand beaches and turquoise waters surrounded by forest-clad
                        mountains make it every traveller's dream destination.

                        beaches. Known for its immaculate landscape of blue and green, Kerala promises travelers an
                        unforgettable seaside staycation. Plan a short vacation to Kerala and unveil the Southern
                        India's stunning secrets. Close your eyes and just imagine that you are lazing on turquoise
